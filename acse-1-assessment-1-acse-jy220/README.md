# ACSE-1 : Modern Programming Practices
## Assessment 1: Cellular Automata

In this programming exercise, you will create a Python module file providing implementations of several simple cellular automata.

See [assessment.pdf](./assessment.pdf) for the full formal exercise definition.

A starter file, `automata.py` is provided and should be updated with your code. A starter test framework is available in the `tests` folder.

__Reminder: This is an individual assessment.__

Although students are encouraged to discuss the problem background and coding techniques with their peers, you should not allow other students to examine your code, nor attempt to view the code of others. In cases of doubt, students may be examined on their submission via oral assessment.

If you use any non-Imperial websites during the course of this assessment, please list them in `References.md`

#### Submission deadline

The final version of your module should be submitted via your GitHub Classrooms repository by 4pm BST on Friday 16th October 2020.

To avoid technical issues, please try to upload versions of your work regularly as you go.
