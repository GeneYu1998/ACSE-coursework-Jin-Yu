# To the marker

I wrote this assessment in serveral .cpp files with separate main() methods. 
Thus, to observe the outcomes, you should compile these questions one by one.
The answer files (.cpp) were named as their order number as given in the assessment sheet (for example, A1.cpp for Question A.1).


## How to build

To compile for each question (for example Question A.1), just enter 

```
$ g++ A1.cpp -o A1 -std=c++11(14/17)

```

at the root of this repository, this will also give you a executable file.

## Ready-to-run Executable files

I have made the executable files for each questions in the `exe` folder, in case you have issues with compiling (though I suppose you will not care about them).
